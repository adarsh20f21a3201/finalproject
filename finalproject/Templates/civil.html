            <p><h3>About Department:</h3>
                Civil Engineering is the improvement of Society through the application of scientific knowledge. Civil engineering traditionally has been sub divided into many other engineering specializations such as Environmental Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Structural Engineering, Earthquake Resistant Engineering, Bridge Engineering, Water Resource Engineering, Geo-technical Engineering, Coastal Engineering, Municipal or Urban Development and Planning and many more.
                <br><br>As the Civil Engineering World is so diverse, Civil Engineers have the most varied career options out of all the major disciplines. Civil Engineers have many career opportunities in both public and private sectors.
                <br><br>@ Gates, the Civil Engineering department was established in the year 2012 with an intake of 60 students which was increased to 120 in the year 2013. Dr T. Raghunath Reddy, (Retired Professor from JNTUA), with all his experience and expertise, has carefully nurtured and grown this department, the department offers best labs and infrastructure for the students to enhance their knowledge in the area of Civil Engineering.
                <br><br>The Department is headed by Mr.J Ritesh . The department has well qualified, dedicated and experienced faculty and committed supporting staff.
